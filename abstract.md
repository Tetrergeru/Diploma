In this paper the problem of construction of regular bipartite graphs with great girth is considered. To solve this problem the special subset of graphs called metagraphs is introduced. Metagraph is a weighted graph for which an operation of expansion that depends on edge weights is specified. The required graph is one of the expansions of the metagraph. Theorems on correspondence between paths and cycles on metagraphs and their expansions are proved. To construct the required graphs the approach with finding of edge weights on metagraph by solving the system of inequalities constructed using the metagraph. The theorem on existence of a solution for any such system is proved. The tight upper bound of expansion graph girth is given. The algorithm that constructs bipartite graphs with any given girth is proposed.
